 * Allow library clients to initiate greedy rather than lazy
   connection handling.

   This would, I think, require significant changes to ::Connection,
   in order to support being called with a callback.

 * Allow unix sockets (just needs some recognition of the format of
   args)

 * Extend test suite to run under multiple AnyEvent event loops, to
   give it a real compatiblity test.

 * Binary stats is not yet implemented.

 * Other hashing mechanisms. Consistent Hashing (patches welcome)
