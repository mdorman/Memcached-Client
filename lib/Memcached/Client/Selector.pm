=head1 NAME

Memcached::Client::Selector - Abstract Base Class For Memcached::Client Selector

=head1 VERSION

version 2.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package NewHash;
  use strict;
  use base qw{Memcached::Client::Selector};

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

C<new()> builds a new object.  It takes no parameters.

=head2 C<log>

Log the specified message with an appropriate prefix derived from the
class name.

=head2 set_servers

C<set_servers()> will initialize the selector from the arrayref of
servers (or server => weight tuples) passed to it.

=head2 get_server

C<get_server()> will use the object's list of servers to extract the
proper server name from the list of connected servers, so the protocol
object can use it to make a request.

This routine can return undef, if called before set_servers has been
called, whether explicitly, or implicitly by handling a list of
servers to the constructor.
