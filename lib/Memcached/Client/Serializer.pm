=head1 VERSION

version 1.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package NewSerializer;
  use strict;
  use base qw{Memcached::Client::Serializer};

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

C<new()> builds a new object.  It takes no parameters.

=head2 deserialize()

C<deserialize()> will do its best to uncompress and/or deserialize the
data that has been returned.

=head2 serialize()

C<serialize()> will serialize the data it is given (if it's a
reference), and if the data is large enough and the savings
significant enough (and the compression code is loadable), it will
compress it as well.
